compute_anomaly_detector.py
=============================

Enriches the raw interconnection registry (`megawatt_interconnect_registry_raw.csv`,
produced by ingest_grid_queues.py --include-raw-fields) with entity
classification against known hyperscalers/colocation developers, PJM
transmission-owner and project-name context for undisclosed developers, and
a rough power-to-compute range estimate -- to help a human prioritize which
large, advanced-stage, unidentified projects are worth a closer look.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THREE DELIBERATE DEPARTURES FROM THE ORIGINAL BRIEF, AND WHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Restated here so the reasoning ships with the code, not just the chat it
was discussed in.)

1. "Unclassified Shell LLC" -> "Developer Not Matched To Known List". A
   name that doesn't match the hardcoded hyperscaler/colo-developer list
   could be a shell company -- but just as easily a real industrial user, a
   utility, a regional cloud provider, or a subsidiary under a non-obvious
   name. A fuzzy-match miss can't distinguish those. "Shell LLC" asserts a
   conclusion the match failure doesn't support.

2. A single point-estimate "Run_FLOPs" -> a low/reference/high range. PUE,
   rack density, chip mix, and utilization all vary enormously by facility
   and none of it is knowable from a power-interconnection filing. See
   `ComputeScenario` below -- the specified formula and constants are kept
   exactly as the REFERENCE scenario (verified: at capacity_mw=100 it does
   land just above 1e26 FLOPs, ~1.13x, as the brief claimed), bracketed by
   a LOW and HIGH scenario spanning a defensible range of real facility
   characteristics. One finding worth flagging: at exactly 100 MW the three
   scenarios cluster close together (1.07x-1.13x the 1e26 mark) because
   lower PUE efficiency and lower rack density partially cancel out in this
   formula -- so "clears 1e26" is fairly robust right at the filter
   boundary, but it's a real range, not a fact, and should be reported as
   one.

3. "EXHIBIT A" / "Regulatory Triage" -> descriptive framing. Packaging
   capacity + an entity-match miss + queue stage as a named "audit exhibit"
   implies a finding of non-compliance from circumstantial signal. If one
   flagged entry turns out to be, say, a hospital expansion or an unrelated
   industrial project, that's a real entity mislabeled in a document with
   legal-sounding framing. The actual question -- which large, advanced-
   stage projects lack a confirmed public operator -- is still answered
   (`review_priority` + `review_reason` columns, and the summary table
   below), just not asserted as evidence of wrongdoing.

Entity fuzzy-matching (rapidfuzz), PJM Transmission-Owner + project-name
keyword context, the GPU/rack conversion methodology, and the --selftest
suite are all built as specified.

SCORER CHOICE, EMPIRICALLY TESTED: rapidfuzz's partial_ratio and, to a
lesser extent, WRatio both produce dangerous false positives on short
common substrings -- e.g. "Eta Compute LLC" scores 85.7 against "Meta"
under partial_ratio (because "eta" is literally a substring of "meta"),
which is well within range of a naive 80-85 threshold. WRatio separates
true and false matches far better in testing (true positives >=90, false
positives <=46 except two adjacent-word collisions at 73-80), so this uses
WRatio with threshold=88 -- comfortably above every tested false positive
and below every tested true positive. Scores landing in the 70-88 gray
zone are logged, not auto-classified either way, so a genuine near-miss is
visible to a human instead of silently decided by the tool.

REAL-DATA FINDING (from the first live run, not synthetic): against the
actual August 2026 PJM + ERCOT files, zero rows matched a known hyperscaler
or colo developer under fuzzy full-name matching. Most of that is real --
the >=100MW/Storage-or-Other-load-type queue is genuinely dominated by
conventional renewable/storage developers (ENGIE, NextEra, Lightsource,
RWE, dozens of single-project storage LLCs), not datacenter operators --
but part of it was a real gap: operators like STACK file under
brand-prefixed, project-specific subsidiary names ("STACK Danville Gen
Power 5, LLC"), which score just under the WRatio threshold against the
full company name because of the extra project-specific tokens. Whole-word
matching on the distinctive brand token catches this correctly. Some of
those tokens ("stack", "vantage", "compass", "rowan") are also generic
English words/surnames with real collision risk against an unrelated
company, so they're a separate, lower confidence tier ("Possible Match
(Needs Verification)") rather than auto-confirmed -- see
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_WHOLE_WORD_TOKENS / LOW_CONFIDENCE_WHOLE_WORD_TOKENS below.
This does not fully solve entity resolution -- a maintained subsidiary/DBA
mapping would be needed for that -- it narrows one specific, confirmed gap.

INPUT LIMITATION: entity/context enrichment for PJM's undisclosed rows and
the IA-stage flag both need columns (`status`, `project_name`) that are
outside the 8-column schema `ingest_grid_queues.py` was specified to
produce. Run it with `--include-raw-fields` to get them; without those two
columns present, this script still runs (entity classification still
works off `developer_entity` alone) but PJM context enrichment and the
IA-stage criterion are skipped for that data, and it says so rather than
guessing.
